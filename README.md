## About
Anonacy's v2 api enables simplified control over a [Postal](https://docs.postalserver.io/) open-source mail server. 

It is designed for email aliasing and can be easily deployed using docker on the same machine as Postal.

You can use the [@anonacy/app](https://github.com/anonacy/app) project as a UI for the api.
