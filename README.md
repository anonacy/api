### About
Anonacy's postal api enables simplified control over a Postal open-source mail server. 

It is designed for email aliasing, by managing the 'Routing' system within Postal, while Postal handles the mail forwarding between smtp servers. 

It also provides a simple way to manage domains and email endpoints, needed for aliases.

### Uses

The API can be used in broader ways, and will continually be enhanced. It works by utilizing direct mySQL queries in Postal's database, as well as using puppeteer for more complex interactions.
